# Project Title
Scope Labs Take Home Assessment

# Frontend - React.js/Typescript and Tailwind
# Backend - Node.js/Express.js 

## Overview

This is a web application that allows users to create, comment on, and watch educational videos. For a given user, they are given the opportunity to create posts, edit posts, comment on posts, and view videos. 

## Features

# Create a post
1. Click the "Create" button once logged in, and simply follow instruction.

# View a post
1. Login
2. Click on a post card on the home page if there are any posts made by the user.
3. If not, create a post, then click into the post card to view post in larger window.

# Make a comment
1. Click into a post card
2. Scroll down and view comments, or add a comment in the "Add comment" section

# Edit a post

1. Click on a post card you would like to edit
2. Click the "Edit Post" button and follow instructions



### Installing

1. Clone this project
2. Open terminal, then at root folder - `npm install`
3. Then - `npm run dev`
4. Open new terminal, navigate into server folder -  `npm install`
5. Then - `npm run dev`
6. Open localhost link provided in terminal

#### Getting Started

1. Click the "Login" button in the top corner. 
2. Depending on which username you type in, the server will fetch videos pertaining to that specific user and display them on the home page. 
3. If a username does not have a post, they can make a post by clicking the "Create Post" button in the Nav Bar.
4. If a user does have a post, feel free to go into a specific post and either edit the post or comment on the post. 

##### Drawbacks

1. For this assessment, a user being able to view all the posts instead of just their own posts would be ideal. This would enable interaction between users, and create more of a social network inside the application. Because the database on FastApi is only set up to fetch for one specific user's videos and not all videos, the post cards displayed will only be the posts made by the user that is logged in. 
2. Was on a bit of a time crunch, so didn't have time to optimize UI/UX design or test.


###### Final Thoughts

I had a blast working on this! This was a great test to some of my skills, both on the front and backend, and enjoyed getting this done. If you have any questions, feel free to reach out!
